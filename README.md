# vagrant_mulitmachine
This repo contains code for creating three vagrant virtual machines, two web servers and one database

# What is this repo for

This repo contains code that when executed will create three virtual box machines that will have a running web server on them.  How to do that you will see [below](#how-to-use-this-repo).


# Why use this repo

You might want to use this repo to gain a better understanding of how Vagrant can work for you. 
In this specific case we use a loop to create two similiar machines and another machine separately. 
This is accomplished by using `(1..2).each do |i|` and specifiying the names of the server as variables `vm_name="web#{i}"`.
Third machine is defined on its own.


# How to use this repo

* You need to have vagrant installed on you workstation
   *  for MacOS
   
    ```
    brew install vagrant
    ```
  
   *  for any other OS click [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

* You also need to have virtualbox installed since this is the virtualization provider we are using in this example.

   * Download [Here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  
* This "How to" will cover macOS specifically, it may vary for other systems.

* Clone this repo locally to a folder of your choice
```
git clone git@github.com:yordanivh/vagrant-multimachine.git
```
* Go inside the newly created folder of the repo

```
cd vagrant-multimachine
```
* Give command to start the machines

```
vagrant up
```
* This is an expected output

```

* After the above is finished you should have three virtual macines named web1, web2 and mysql. You can confirm this by running `vagrant status`

```
‚ùØ vagrant status
Current machine states:

web1                      running (virtualbox)
web2                      running (virtualbox)
mysql                     running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
```

* When you are done with this destroy the created environment to save resources

```
vagrant destroy
```
